   abstract = {Gillnet fisheries are one of the main anthropogenic causes of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena L., 1758) mortality in the Baltic Sea. A new kind of acoustic alerting device (Porpoise ALert, PAL) was tested in commercial gillnet fisheries in the western Baltic. PAL emits 133 kHz synthetic harbour porpoise communication signals, unlike conventional acoustic deterrent devices (pingers), which emit artificial noise. Trials were undertaken by three commercial gillnet vessels conducting 778 trips during standard fishing operations from 2014 to 2016. In all, 1120 PAL-equipped net strings were tested against 1529 simultaneously set control strings with no devices. We tested two versions of the PAL (v1 and v2) consecutively. These were spaced <=210 m apart on the gillnet floatlines, with all devices pointing in the same direction to ensure complete acoustic coverage of the strings. Two vessels fished in Kiel Bight and around Fehmarn Island in German waters, and the third vessel fished in the Øresund, in inner Danish waters. Overall, 18 harbour porpoises were bycaught in control strings (mean 0.01 ± 0.1/haul), and five harbour porpoises were taken as bycatch in strings equipped with PALs (0.004 ± 0.07/haul). The number of net string bycatches was analysed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). The model applied to all observations revealed that the expected bycatch was significantly influenced by PAL deployment (p < 0.05), decreasing the expected bycatch by 64.9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 8.7–88.7 %). PAL effectiveness was also increased by reducing device spacing to <=200 m (16 bycatches in control, three in PAL strings; mean bycatch reduction 79.7 %). Additional model cases were applied to the data and are discussed. We conclude that, with this specific communication signal, PAL can significantly reduce harbour porpoise bycatch in gillnets deployed in the western Baltic Sea, thus reconciling anthropogenic activities with protection of the marine environment.},

   abstract = {Studies concerning the echolocation behaviour of odontocetes focus mainly on target detection and discrimination, either in stationary animals or in animals approaching a specific target. We present the first data on the use of echolocation for spatial orientation or navigation. Synchronised video and high-frequency recordings were made of two harbour porpoises trained to swim from one position to another across an outdoor pool in order to correlate swimming and echolocation behaviour. Both porpoises showed a clear range-locking behaviour on specific positions near the end of the pool, as indicated by a decrease in click interval with decreasing distance. The decrease in click interval followed the two-way-transit time, which is the time interval between the outgoing click and the received echo from the focal object. This suggests that the porpoises used focal objects as landmarks. The lag time, defined as the time between the arrival of an echo from a landmark and the emission of the next click, was task specific. The lag time was longer for difficult tasks (26-36 ms) and shorter for simpler tasks (14-19 ms), with some individual differences between the two animals. Our results suggest that echolocation by odontocetes is used not only for target detection, localisation and classification but also for spatial orientation.},

   abstract = {Social delphinids employ a vocal repertoire of clicks for echolocation and whistles for communication. Conversely, the less social and acoustically cryptic harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) only produce narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) clicks with properties that appear poorly suited for communication. Nevertheless, these small odontocetes likely mediate social interactions, such as mate choice and mother-calf contact, with sound. Here, we deployed six tags (DTAG3) on wild porpoises in Danish waters for a total of 96 hours to investigate if the patterns and use of stereotyped NBHF click trains are consistent with a communication function. We show that wild porpoises produce frequent (up to 27 min-1), high-repetition rate click series with repetition rates and output levels different from those of foraging buzzes. These sounds are produced in bouts and frequently co-occur with emission of similar sounds by nearby conspecifics, audible on the tags for >10% of the time. These results suggest that social interactions are more important to this species than their limited social encounters at the surface may indicate and that these interactions are mediated by at least two broad categories of calls composed of short, high-repetition rate click trains that may encode information via the repetition rate of their stereotyped NBHF clicks.},

   abstract = {The harbor porpoise is one of the smallest and most widely spread of all toothed whales. They are found abundantly in coastal waters all around the northern hemisphere. They are among the 11 species known to use high frequency sonar of relative narrow bandwidth. Their narrow biosonar beam helps isolate echoes from prey among those from unwanted items and noise. Obtaining echoes from small objects like net mesh, net floats, and small prey is facilitated by the very high peak frequency around 130 kHz with a wavelength of about 12 mm. We argue that such echolocation signals and narrow band auditory filters give the harbor porpoise a selective advantage in a coastal environment. Predation by killer whales and a minimum noise region in the ocean around 130 kHz may have provided selection pressures for using narrow bandwidth high frequency biosonar signals. © 2013 Miller and Wahlberg.},

   abstract = {Odontocetes produce a range of different echolocation clicks but four groups in different families have converged on producing the same stereotyped narrow band high frequency (NBHF) click. In microchiropteran bats, sympatric species have evolved the use of different acoustic niches and subtly different echolocation signals to avoid competition among species. In this study, we examined whether similar adaptations are at play among sympatric porpoise species that use NBHF echolocation clicks. We used a six-element hydrophone array to record harbour and Dall's porpoises in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and harbour porpoises in Denmark. The click source properties of all porpoise groups were remarkably similar and had an average directivity index of 25 dB. Yet there was a small, but consistent and significant 4 kHz difference in centroid frequency between sympatric Dall's (137±3 kHz) and Canadian harbour porpoises (141±2 kHz). Danish harbour porpoise clicks (136±3 kHz) were more similar to Dall's porpoise than to their conspecifics in Canada. We suggest that the spectral differences in echolocation clicks between the sympatric porpoises are consistent with evolution of a prezygotic isolating barrier (i.e., character displacement) to avoid hybridization of sympatric species. In practical terms, these spectral differences have immediate application to passive acoustic monitoring. © 2013 Kyhn et al.},

The book includes inspiring exercises for education school programs in natural sciences. The book also provides advice on career paths using case studies of marine scientists and veterinarians describing their journeys from student to profession. By sharing real-life career paths, readers find answers to questions such as “What needs to be considered when choosing a career in science?" and “What kind of tasks do scientists undertake on a daily basis?" Marine mammals are amongst some of the most celebrated creatures on Earth, with their high intelligence, social and communicating skills, and capacity for deep diving. Alongside general information about marine mammals, the book aims at generating awareness of the impact of litter and noise pollution on the marine environment using marine mammals as an example. Huge numbers of marine animals, including marine mammals, die every year from entanglement in fishing gear, by ingestion of litter or because of chemical pollution. In the last decade many technological and scientific tools have been developed to aid research, for instance miniaturised sound recorders which can be attached to cetaceans and seals and record noise levels around them, their vocal production as well as their diving behaviour. This Open Access textbook can be used by undergraduate students interested in the fundamentals of marine mammal biology and medicine, and in pursuing the profession of a marine scientist.},

   abstract = {Echolocation behaviour of a harbor porpoise and six finless porpoises was recorded in open-water systems using acoustic data loggers (A-tag). In total 1359 click trains were recorded during 4.6 h for the harbor porpoise and 46,240 click trains were recorded during 82.3 h for the finless porpoises. The harbor and finless porpoises produced sonar click trains every 12.3 and 6.4 s on average, respectively. During the inter-click-train interval, the porpoises were silent or produced clicks below 148 dB re. 1 μ Pa, the detection threshold of the tag. Ninety percent of the inter-click-train intervals were 20 s or less in both species. This means that porpoises frequently produce intense click trains. Click-train intervals lasting over 50 s constituted 1% of the total intervals in finless porpoises and 4% in the harbor porpoise. Both species swam without intense clicks for less than 10 m in most cases, but occasionally remained silent or used undetected low-intensity clicks for more than 1 min. During these periods, the porpoises would be susceptible to entanglement in fishing nets. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We used our novel and programmable Porpoise Alarm (PAL, patd.) to synthesize life-like, electronic harbour porpoise communication signals based on those described for captive animals. In the Little Belt, Denmark, we employed PAL (source level 158 ± 1 dB p-p re 1 Pa@1 m; centroid frequency 133 ± 8.5 kHz) to synthesize three aggressive click train types termed "A", "F3" and "M1" to naive, free-living harbour porpoises. Via theodolite tracking (372 h of total visual effort spread over 10 expeditions) we found that, depending on signal type, porpoises either avoid or become attracted to PAL: Signal types "A" and "F3" are slight deterrents, porpoises increasing minimum range (+23 to 32 m, respectively), whereas "M1" attracts porpoises, reducing range (by - 29 m). As determined via archival acoustic detectors (AADs), both signals "F3" and "M1" led the animals to significantly intensify their click rate (by +10% and 68%, respectively) while signal "A" led to a significant reduction (- 59%). We propose that equipping fishing gear with PAL emitting signal "F3" could potentially reduce porpoise by-catch by increasing (1) awareness through enhanced echolocation and (2) distance to the nets. Detection probability and radius of PAL/AAD tandems could be improved by emitting signal "M1" to focus porpoise echolocation signals on the AAD. The signal may also be useful in luring animals away from hazards, which may be helpful for conservation measures prior to the onset of harmful acoustic activities such as pile-driving, seismic exploration or ammunition clearance.},

   abstract = {The harbour porpoise is the only resident cetacean species in the German Baltic Sea. Within the last several decades this harbour porpoise stock declined drastically, causing deep concern about its status. Plans of the German government for proposing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to implement Natura 2000 and for assessing the impact of offshore windmill constructions on the marine environment led to an increased research effort on the harbour porpoise in German waters. For the first time, long-term passive acoustic monitoring has been conducted in the German Baltic Sea from the Kiel Bight to the Pomeranian Bay from August 2002 to December 2005. Porpoise detectors (T-PODs) have been installed five to seven metres below the water surface at up to 42 measuring positions throughout the investigated area, registering the exact times of echolocation signals of passing harbour porpoises. The proportion of monitored days with porpoise detection in each quarter of the years has been analysed. A correlation of the results with the longitude of the measuring position revealed a significant decrease from west to east in the percentage of days with porpoise detections. Comparison of data gathered in the first quarters with the third quarters of the monitoring years displayed a seasonal variation with fewer days of porpoise detections in winter time than in summer time. Nevertheless, harbour porpoises have been detected year-round at most of the measuring positions in the German Baltic Sea. The present study clearly indicates a regular use of the German Baltic Sea by harbour porpoises with a geographical and seasonal variation in the usage of the German Baltic Sea. The larger numbers of harbour porpoise detections in spring to autumn compared with winter suggests that the German Baltic Sea is an important breeding and mating area for these animals. © 2007 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.},
