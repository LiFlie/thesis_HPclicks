\section{Summary/Abstract}

\section{Introduction}
harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) as an endangered species, affected by fisheries and often being bycatch
use of PAL to reduces bycatch effectively --> short explanation how PAL works

\subsection{Objective of the Work/Motivation}
Aim: determine whether harbour porpoise show significant differences in their echolocation behaviour around nets between germany and denmark

\section{First Information (Theory)}
mammals in germany have been exposd to PALS (explain somewhere??) since 2017

\subsection{Harbour Porpoises, Echolocation}
harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) s a marine mammal in the Phocoenidae family, members of the toothed whale family
prefer coastal, shallow waters
IUCN red list status: baltic sea population is citically endangered
bycatch is one of the major anthropogenic threats to marine mammals (quantitative measueres scarce, bycatch not well documented/incidents rarely reported) \cite{brennecke2023marine}
\section{Material and Methods}


\subsection{Area of Research}
The used Data was obtained in Germany and Denmark. Three reference points of Observation in each country with three obersavtion periods
Map of area with postioned FPODS: 

Eight fishers selected to use PAL.

\subsection{PAM/Acoustic Monitoring}
observation method where acoustic device is deployed in ocean to capture sounds from surrounding environment, doesn't produce sound itself 


\subsection{FPODs, Software/Data Processing}
What they are and where they've been used, use of click trains.
Setup FPOD and PAL?
fully automatic, static, passive monitoring systems,  limited spatial coverage, continously collect data for months
detection of echolocation clicks and click trains of porpoises, dolphins and other toothed whales
logs different parameters of narrow-band high-frequency clicks, like time, duration, frequency, sound pressure etc.
The KERNO CLassifier of the FPOD.exe software combines individual clicks into click trains which have their own characteristics (time, duration, frequeny, sound pressure, inter-click-interval etc.)
list of all parameters that are obtained for clicks and click trains:

\subsection{Software, Data Processing}
Use of software R, packages, statistical tests, hypothesis, significance of parameters: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis (more than two datasets), effect-size calculation: eta-squared
