%shows old findings of that topic, importance of your work 
%what question/problem did you study?
%not too technical, provides general information
%literature review, explain what other researchers have found on your topic
harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) as an endangered species, affected by fisheries and often being bycatched
use of PAL to reduces bycatch effectively --> short explanation how PAL works
mammals in germany have been exposd to PALS (explain somewhere??) since 2017

\subsection{Harbour Porpoises, Echolocation}
%possibel subsections; systematics, morphology/conservation status, distribution, behaviour/echolocatio
\subsubsection{General Information}
The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a member of the family Phocoenidae, is one of the smallest and most widespread species among toothed whales \cite{Miller2013}. \\
The subspecies inhabiting the waters around Germany, particularly in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, is Phocoena phocoena phocoena, which is commonly found in the North Atlantic. \\
These marine mammals are elusive and difficult to observe, as they rarely engage in surface behaviors such as bow-riding, making them hard to spot.\cite{Brennecke2023} \\
They typically form small groups consisting of fewer than eight individuals and are predominantly found in coastal waters throughout the northern hemisphere \cite{Miller2013} \\ %or {brennecke, marine mammals} 
The Baltic Sea harbour porpoises can be divided into two subpopulations: those in the Belt Sea and those in the central Baltic Sea, which are also sometimes categorized as the Inner Danish Waters and the broader Baltic Sea \cite{Culik2011}. \\
The different subpopulations of harbour porpoises are not known to migrate extensively, with movement generally confined to their specific regions \\ %cite{???}.
While the IUCN classifies the species as "Least Concern" globally, the Baltic Sea population is listed as critically endangered, and the North Sea population is considered near threatened, although the exact number of individuals remains uncertain \cite{Brennecke2023}. \\
Harbour porpoises feed on a wide variety of fish and cephalopods, their primary prey items vary depending on regional and seasonal factors \cite{Jefferson1995}. Prey species are generally less than 40 cm in length, with most ranging between 10 and 30 cm. However, their feeding behavior brings them into contact with two significant threats—persistent organic contaminants and fishing nets—both of which pose serious risks to their health and survival \\ %\cite{Culik2011}.
Porpoises are caught in a variety of fishing gear, including weirs, pound nets, cod traps, purse seine nets, and surface gill nets. However, the vast majority of bycatch mortality occurs in bottom-set gill nets, posing a critical threat to the species \cite{Culik2011}. \\

\subsubsection{Echolocation}
%picture for better understanding of function echolocation
have biosonar, use the so-called “phonic lips”, an organ similar to the vocal folds, to produce short, high-frequency clicks
are bundled in the melon, an organ made up of different layers of fatty tissue, and released into the water as sound waves
used for orientation, navigation, communication, and hunting
sound waves travel through water with a velocity of 1500 m per s (4,5 times faster than in air), reflected by objects in the water, and return to the porpoise
is taken up again by the porpoise via the lower jaw, a very thin hollow bone
There is also a fatty channel there that transmits the bundled waves to the inner ear, click sounds are registered and the information obtained is then processed by the brain
the echo is used to determine the distance, size, shape, speed, and direction of movement of objects in the water
the frequence of the clicks is between 130 and 150 kHz (humans can only hear until 20kHz)
harbour porpoises almost constantly send out a series of clicks and it's therefore a good way to detect and monitor them
%explanation click trains, ICIs

\subsubsection{Bycatch}
in baltic sea for harbour porpoise no natural predators, only threat is humans, anthropogenic threats
bycatch is one of the major anthropogenic threats to marine mammals (quantitative measueres scarce, bycatch not well documented/incidents rarely reported) \cite{Brennecke2023}
Most fishing nets today are made from very thin nylon threads. These cannot locate the porpoises in time because the sound is not sufficiently reflected by the nets
Once caught in the nets, they can no longer swim to the surface to breathe and drown or at least suffer serious injuries

%put explanation of PAL and FPD Sin introduction or beginnning of materials?

\subsection{PAM/Acoustic Monitoring, PALs}
observation method where acoustic device is deployed in ocean to capture sounds from surrounding environment, doesn't produce sound itself 

bycatch as one of the biggest challenges for nature conservation 
Since December 2013, Schleswig-Holstein has had a voluntary agreement between the fishing associations, the Baltic Sea Information Center Eckernförde (OIC) and the state of Schleswig-Holstein
Under this voluntary agreement, participating fishermen must shorten their nets depending on the length of their vessel. Since 2018, fishermen who equip their nets with Porpoise Alerting Devices (PAL) devices no longer have to reduce the length of the net
explanation of PAL:

PALs emit artificial porpoise-like clicks that resemble an aggressive click sequence and are intended to alarm the porpoises and alert them to possible danger. This system is designed to ensure that the porpoises learn over time that the signal is associated with potential danger. 

PAL is a spindle-shaped acoustic transducer optimized for use in fisheries. It emits a single
synthetic signal termed “F3” (Culik et al. 2015) consisting of two upsweep chirps beginning
with a click rate of 173 clicks/s and ending with 959 clicks/s. PAL has a centroid frequency
of 133 ± 8.5 kHz; mean source level 147 dB peak – peak re 1 %μ Pa@1 m (± 5 dB Standard
Deviation; n = 36 measurements in 10 ◦ around the longitudinal axis, and a close-range
audible signal envelope 8 kHz). Signal duration and repetition pattern fulfil the requirements
for ADDs set in EU Regulation 812/2004 (CEC, 2004) emitting a series of one to three signals
at random followed by a randomized 

While this principle has been shown to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch rates, it is currently unclear

whether PALs work over long periods of time or whether they become less effective at reducing bycatch over time,
whether PALs permanently alert porpoises, or whether this principle changes over time,\\
and how PALs can influence the spatial distribution of harbor porpoises over longer periods of time. % --> Project PAL-CE


\subsection{FPODs, Software/Data Processing}
What they are and where they've been used, use of click trains.
Setup FPOD and PAL? %picture of FPOD and setup at net
fully automatic, static, passive monitoring systems,  limited spatial coverage, continously collect data for months
detection of echolocation clicks and click trains of porpoises, dolphins and other toothed whales
logs different parameters of narrow-band high-frequency clicks, like time, duration, frequency, sound pressure etc.
The KERNO CLassifier of the FPOD.exe software combines individual clicks into click trains which have their own characteristics (time, duration, frequeny, sound pressure, inter-click-interval etc.)
list of all parameters that are obtained for clicks and click trains:

\subsection{Hypothesis of Work, Aims of Study} %Arbeitshypothesen, Echoortung de und dk unterscheidet sich
Objective of Work/Aim: determine whether harbour porpoise show significant differences in their echolocation behavior around nets between germany and denmark

\section{Material and Methods}
%WHEN the study was carried out
%WHERE the study was carried out
%WHAT materials, techniques, samples, data, approaches, theoretical frameworks were used in the study
%HOW the study was carried out
%WHAT procedures were used. 

%Adopt the view of an outsider, someone unfamiliar with the project but familiar with the field. 
%Be aware of any key information about method that was included in the abstract or introduction, but try to avoid repetition of the exact phrasing used elsewhere. 
%Do not include too many details; don't omit details that reduce accuracy or clarity. 
%Provide the reader with a paper trail; if a previously published article explains a complex method in details then cite the article so that the reader knows where to find the relevant information. 
%Give credit where credit is due, citing other studies that have informed your method; if the method is described in multiple works then cite the one where it was first or best explained. 
%Be careful not too leave out obvious but crucial information when describing very familiar techniques or steps.
%Share a list of the steps for your method with a friend or colleague; if he or she can responsibly repeat the project and based on what is read test your same hypothesis, then your description is probably a solid one. 
%Imagine that your reader wants to skim this part of the paper and still catch the most important information about materials and methods. 
%Use subheadings to organize information; these will also assist the reader in skimming your work.  Examples of subheadings
\subsection{Data recording,Area of Research}
The used Data was obtained throughout the PAL-CE Project ("PAL use in German waters - Current efficiency and mode of operation"), managed by the German Maritime Museum in Stralsund and and financed by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation (BfN).
In 2017 a few Fishers (Eight fishers selected in the beginning) in Schleswig-Holstein voluntarily attached PAL-Devices (Porpoise-ALert) to their fisher nets in order to reduce the bycatch of harbour porpoises in the baltic Sea. %freiwillige Vereinbarung 
The Thuenen-institute for fishery in the Baltic Sea and other partners now research if the proven effects of these devices also lasts over a long period of time.
While the PALs have been proven effected in Germany, where Harbour Porpoises have been exposed since 2017, the mammals in Denmark are considered naive. This give us the opportunity to wheter harbour porpoises show siginificant differences in their echolocation behaviour aorund nets with PAL between Germany and Denmark.  
Answer questions by comparing the echolocation behavior and approach distances of porpoises in areas where porpoises may be habituated (waters off Schleswig-Holstein) and in areas where porpoises are most likely less habituated (waters off the northern coast of Denmark and/or Sweden ). In addition, the project involves working with fishermen in a stakeholder process to jointly evaluate the voluntary agreement in its current form and to develop possible improvements to this agreement together with fishermen

Three reference points of Observation, defining key fishing spots, in each country with three observation periods to get reference data. Each Station has been equipped with a click Detector (FPOD).
The FPOD, as a passive acoustic monitoring device, detects the narrow-band high-frequency echolocation clicks of harbour porpoises and logs specific parameters for aech click. A List of all Parameters, such as time, duration, frequency, can be found in the Attachement %list of paraeters single clicks
During post-prossesing the KERNO-F classifier of the FPOD-system identifies click trains using a non-machine earning algorithm that evaluates coherence and feature changes in clicks. As well as the raw click data, the processed train data is saved in files with features like frequency, bandwith, inter-click intervals and other classifications.
